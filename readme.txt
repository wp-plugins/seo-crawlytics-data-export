Exports all entries of Seo Crawlytics and gives you the option to delete the entries that are older than 1 month.


== Description ==

This plugin exports all entries of [Seo Crawlytics](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-crawlytics/ "Seo Crawlytics") and gives you the option to delete the entries that are older than 1 month.

We noticed that the size of the SeoCrawlytics table in the database can get huge if your website has visits while using "WP Clean UP" to clean up WordPress installations and so we created this plugin.

Disable when not in use.
